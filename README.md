Markup Basics 2 - Coursework

This repository tracks my progress in the Markup Basics 2 course at Blackhawk Technical College (Spring 2026).

The primary objective of these assignments is to move beyond basic coding and establish a professional development workflow. This includes mastering the integration between Visual Studio 2022 and GitHub, managing local repositories, and understanding file structure.

Project Overview

1. Assignment-1-Images
Skill Focus: File paths, extensions, and media embedding.
Built a SpaceX-themed detail page to practice linking different image formats (`.gif`, `.jpg`, `.png`).
Focused on relative file paths and folder organization within the solution.

2. Assignment-2-Tables
Skill Focus: Semantic HTML and data structure.
Resume Project* Constructed a complex resume layout using HTML Tables.
Manually coded `colspan`, `thead`, and `tfoot` tags to understand the underlying structure of grid-based data.

Development Environment & Workflow
This repsitory serves as a practical exercise in using industry-standard tools:
IDE: Visual Studio 2022 (Enterprise/Community)
Version Control: Git & GitHub (creating commits, managing `.gitignore`, and pushing changes).

AI Integration & Workflow
I view proficiency with AI as a necessary skill for the modern developer. To that end, I utilized Google Gemini in this project to simulate a real-world professional workflow.

The Strategy:** I treat AI as a technical advisor—using it to troubleshoot environment errors (like OneDrive sync conflicts), generate `.gitignore` templates, and explain Git commands.
he Distinction: While AI assisted with configuration and "why" questions, all HTML markup and logic were hand-coded.
he Goal: To build the muscle memory required for syntax while simultaneously learning how to leverage AI tools to solve configuration blockers efficiently—a critical skill for today's and tomorrow's coding landscape.
